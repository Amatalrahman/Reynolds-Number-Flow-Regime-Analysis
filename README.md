# üî¨ Assignment 01: Reynolds Number and Flow Regime Analysis

This project explores the fundamental principles of **fluid kinetics** by analyzing the dimensionless **Reynolds Number (Re)** and its critical role in classifying flow regimes (Laminar, Transitional, and Turbulent). The work was conducted as a group assignment for the **Biotransport (SBEG201)** course.

## üéØ Project Objectives

1.  **Computational Modeling:** Develop a robust tool to calculate Re for various fluids (including biofluids like blood and CSF) and pipe geometries.
2.  **Visualization:** Generate comparative plots to visualize the profound shift in flow behavior: velocity profiles and friction factors ($f$).
3.  **Flow Regime Analysis:** Statistically analyze and visually conceptualize the differences between Laminar (orderly) and Turbulent (chaotic) flow.

## ‚ú® Key Findings & Deliverables

### 1. The Re Shift (Part 1)
The analysis confirmed that flow dynamics are determined by the $\mathbf{Viscous/Inertial}$ forces ratio. High viscosity (e.g., Honey) maintains low Re, while high velocity/diameter (e.g., Water at $V=2 \text{ m/s}$) rapidly pushes the flow into the **Turbulent** regime.

### 2. Profile Transformation (Part 2)
Visualization showed the dramatic change in velocity distribution:
* **Laminar:** Perfectly **Parabolic** profile ($\mathbf{V_{\text{max}} = 2 V_{\text{avg}}}$).
* **Turbulent:** **Flat/Blunt** profile ($\mathbf{V_{\text{max}} < 2 V_{\text{avg}}}$) due to intensive mixing.

### 3. Frictional Resistance (Part 3)
The log-log plot of $f$ vs. Re demonstrated the governing equations:
* **Laminar:** $f$ is highly sensitive to Re ($\mathbf{f \propto 1/Re}$).
* **Turbulent:** $f$ is less sensitive to Re ($\mathbf{f \propto 1/Re^{0.25}}$), as friction becomes dominated by inertial eddies.

### 4. Interactive Tool (Part 4)
A functional MATLAB GUI was created, providing instant $\text{Re}$ calculation and color-coded regime classification.
